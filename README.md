## old project, but new

This project was born out of wanting to learn about:

1. the [Web Components API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
2. the differences between that and using [Lit.dev](https://lit.dev/)
3. modern tooling, namely:
   1. [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/)
   2. [@web/dev-server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/)

This led to [artistic elements](https://github.com/skoch/artistic-elements) which has been incorporated into this project.

Real basic templating, super simple config.

Create React App was so 3 years ago, Web Components FTW.
